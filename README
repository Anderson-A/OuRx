Team project 4
First Sprint
Kate Cheney, Anderson Adon, Rachel Rosset, Jake Flynn

Our goals for this sprint were to build a basic skeleton and organize data (medication) into properly scheduled cards. We believed we accomplished
this goal, as medication can be added and displayed in the schedule and cabinet. 

Features:
1. Medication Schedule
    - This displays upcoming and past medications (currently hardcoded in -- all database tasks are for the next sprint)
        - When we implement a database, we will sort medication from the last 24 hours into these two array adapters
    - If a medication is still in upcoming past the time it was supposed to be taken, it will be red
    - Added swipe functionality from past to upcoming 
    - Added long press to move cards from past-to-upcoming and vice versa 

2. Add Medication
    - Allows a user to add a new medication to his/her cabinet
    - User can enter information like dosage, if they should take with food or water, and how often they'd like to be reminded
    - the medicine will then appear in the medicine cabinet.

3. Medicine Cabinet
    - Shows a user their medication. 
    - Also shows a the medicine dosage.
