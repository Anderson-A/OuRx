Team project 4
First Sprint
Kate Cheney, Anderson Adon, Rachel Rosset, Jake Flynn

Overview: Our goals for this sprint were to build a basic skeleton and organize data (medication) into properly scheduled cards. We believe 
we accomplished this goal. We decided to only (for demo purposes) allow adding a single medication to cabinet/schedule because when we implement
the database we will be adding the medication strictly to the database and then refreshing from the database whenever a new page is loaded.  

Features:
1. Medication Schedule
    - This displays upcoming and past medications (currently hardcoded in -- all database tasks are for the next sprint)
        - When we implement a database, we will sort medication from the last 24 hours into these two array adapters
    - If a medication is still in upcoming past the time it was supposed to be taken, it will be red
    - Added swipe functionality from past to upcoming 
    - Added long press to move cards from past-to-upcoming and vice versa 

2. Add Medication
    - Allows a user to add a new medication to his/her cabinet
    - User can enter information like dosage, if they should take with food or water, and how often they'd like to be reminded
    - the medicine will then appear in the medicine cabinet.

3. Medicine Cabinet
    - Shows a user their medication. 
    - Also shows a the medicine dosage. 
    
Second Sprint
Jake broke the build. What a dumb guy.
GOALS:
1) Change the schedule and cabinet from activities to fragmenmts
2) Integrate a working database
3) Create activity for Medication Information that also lets the user edit the information
4) Implement deletes and location changes in schedule on card long press
5) (Optional) Notifications shown on screen when it's time to take medication
6) (Essential) Don't let Jake break the build again... :(

Sprint 2 README

  Team project 4
  Second Sprint
  Kate Cheney, Anderson Adon, Rachel Rosset, Jake Flynn
 
  Goals Overview:
     - Create Database
     - Turn Cabinet and Schedule to Fragments (started as activities)
     - Medication Info view (what shows up when you click on a medicine card)
     - Implement logic for switching med cards between "past" and "upcoming"
     - Deletion of medications from cabinet
     - Bonus: Basic Google Maps API interaction for Pharmacy Maps
  
 General notes: Maps Search does not work (we decided to implement the basic
 functionality even though it is a part of Sprint 3). But the maps API works
 and the search bar autofills with names being searched. Note, you might have to
 update your Google Play services to see it. We also have testing as a big "TODO"
 in our next sprint outline.
 
 Task Breakdown:
 Jake:
 - Create an activity for medication info
 - Edit database from within medication info
 - Fix Add Medication layout

 Kate:
 - Build database skeleton w/ persistence
 - Help Jake with SQL queries to display medication info
 - Fix layouts for tablet screen
 - Link to Google Maps API when pharmacy is clicked on
 - Autofill Google maps search bar
 - Fix med cards so that long text names aren’t cut off

 Rachel:
 - Context menus to “skip” medication from schedule (done, needs testing)
 - Context menus to migrate medication from upcoming to taken (done needs testing)
 - Context menus
 - Update database with 5 times, 5 “taken” and 5 “forgotten” fields to help migration log    ic
 - Make no context menu in past
 - Add similar “undo” button from cabinet fragment

 Anderson:
 - Convert activities to fragments
 - Context menus in cabinet with deletion option
 - Delete a medication from the database
 - Notifications (optional but working on it)


 Still left to do:
 - Notifications
 - Improve maps functionality
 - TEST!!!!!
